## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

1. **index.html**: 
   - The main landing page, containing the main content of the page, including images, animations, and text.
   - Navigate to the "/game-details" page when the "Learn More" button is clicked.

### Routes

1. **Home Route ('/')**: 
   - Renders the index.html file upon an HTTP GET request to the home page.

2. **Game Details Route ('/game-details')**:
   - Renders a separate "game-details.html" file, which is not required for this task but can be incorporated to provide more details about the game.
